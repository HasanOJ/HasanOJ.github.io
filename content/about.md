# About Me

Hi, I'm **Hasan Algafri** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science @ HHU, with broad interests in deep learning, including but not limited to Representation Learning, Generative Models, and Reinforcement Learning.

## Research & Interests

Recently, my research has focused on developing efficient and innovative model architectures and training strategies. I also come across other topics that I enjoy thinking about, such as:

- **Theory of Deep Learning** - Understanding the fundamental principles behind neural networks
- **Interpretability** - Making AI systems more transparent and understandable
- **Multimodal Learning** - Working with multiple types of data simultaneously
